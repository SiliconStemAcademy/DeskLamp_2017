# Silicon Stem Academy WiFi Lamp

This repository is for the code that runs the Silicon STEM Academy WiFi lamp.  This code includes control through both the accelerometer and the smartphone interface.  This read me includes information for how to install the necessary libraries and other prerequisites.  It also includes a bill of materials for the lamp so parts can be replaced as necessary.  

Read the Instructions PDF located in this repository for instructions on how to install all the dependancies and set up your desklamp.
